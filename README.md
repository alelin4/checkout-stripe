# checkout-stripe
This is a small Stripe shop to test stripe Checkout. My shop is about dog collars and to start up this prodject you first need to.
Download the projekt and start it up.
Go to the map by cd .\stripe_checkout-1-main\
Then go to each folder client and server.
Use npm install in them.
You will need a .env file with your stripe key.
